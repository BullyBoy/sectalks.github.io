## But I am new to security, can I still join?

SecTalks is always open to anyone who is keen to learn infosec.
The entry challenge is designed to be solvable by beginners. A little bit of effort will solve it. There will be people willing to mentor you on the day, and you'll be solving CTF's in no time flat.
